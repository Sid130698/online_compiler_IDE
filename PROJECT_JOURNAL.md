## Day 2 (October 9, 2023)

 **Objectives** :

* Implement socket communication for code submissions.

 **Progress** :

* Researched Java socket programming for client-server communication.
* Implemented server-side socket code to listen for incoming connections.
* Created initial client-side socket code to establish a connection.

 **Challenges** :

* Understanding socket programming concepts and nuances.
* Handling incoming socket connections and data streams.

 **Solutions** :

* Studied online resources and tutorials on socket programming in Java.
* Utilized try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.


### Day 3:

**Objective**: Implement code execution functionality on the backend (Java).

- Create a Java project for your backend.
- Implement a simple HTTP server using Java's built-in `HttpServer` or a library like Jetty.
- Design API endpoints that can receive code from the frontend.
- Create a service or function for code compilation and execution in Java.
- Test the backend code execution functionality with sample code snippets.

### Day 4:

**Objective**: Complete basic error handling and display code execution results on the frontend.

- Implement error handling in the backend for code compilation and execution failures.
- Update the frontend to display code execution output and error messages.
- Test error handling to ensure proper handling of success and error cases.

### Day 5:

**Objective**: User interface improvements.

- Enhance the user interface with features like resizable panes and improved styling.
- Implement a feature for users to save and load code projects.
- Test the updated user interface and project management features.

### Day 6:

**Objective**: Integration testing and documentation.

- Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless frontend and backend interaction.
- Document your project, including user guides and developer documentation.

### Day 7:

**Objective**: Security, Optimization, and Deployment.

- Strengthen security measures on the backend.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to protect against code injection.
- Profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.

### Day 8:

**Objective**: Optimization.

- Optimize code execution, especially in the backend.
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequently used data.
- Fine-tune database queries if applicable.

### Day 9:

**Objective**: Deployment Preparation.

- Select a deployment environment (e.g., cloud hosting, a dedicated server).
- Prepare your application for deployment by configuring environment variables.
- Ensure all dependencies and libraries are up-to-date.

### Day 10:

**Objective**: Deployment.

- Deploy your application to the selected environment.
- Configure web server settings and firewall rules.
- Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) if applicable.

### Day 11:

**Objective**: User Feedback and Refinements.

- Collect user feedback from beta testers or early users.
- Identify areas for improvement and prioritize enhancements.
- Implement user-suggested features and refinements.

### Day 12:

**Objective**: Comprehensive Testing.

- Conduct thorough testing of all application features.
- Perform regression testing to ensure new changes haven't introduced issues.
- Consider load testing to evaluate how the application handles heavy traffic.

### Day 13:

**Objective**: Performance Evaluation.

- Analyze the application's performance in the production environment.
- Monitor server resource usage and application response times.
- Make performance optimizations as needed.

### Day 14:

**Objective**: Final Enhancements and Release.

- Address any remaining bugs or issues.
- Ensure code is well-documented.
- Prepare for a formal release if you're planning to make the project public.
- Celebrate your accomplishments and acknowledge your progress.
