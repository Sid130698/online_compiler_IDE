## Day 2 (October 9, 2023)

 **Objectives** :

* Implement socket communication for code submissions.

 **Progress** :

* Researched Java socket programming for client-server communication.
* Implemented server-side socket code to listen for incoming connections.
* Created initial client-side socket code to establish a connection.

 **Challenges** :

* Understanding socket programming concepts and nuances.
* Handling incoming socket connections and data streams.

 **Solutions** :

* Studied online resources and tutorials on socket programming in Java.

## Day 3:

**Objective**: Implement code execution functionality on the backend (Java).

- Set up a Java project for your backend using Spring Boot.
- Implement an API endpoint that can receive code from the frontend.
- Create a service or function for code compilation and execution.
- Test the backend code execution functionality with sample code snippets.

## Day 4:

**Objective**: Complete basic error handling and display code execution results on the frontend.

- Implement error handling in the backend for code compilation and execution failures.
- Update the frontend to display code execution output and error messages.
- Test error handling to ensure proper handling of success and error cases.

## Day 5:

**Objective**: User interface improvements.

- Enhance the user interface with features like resizable panes and improved styling.
- Implement a feature for users to save and load code projects.
- Test the updated user interface and project management features.

## Day 6:

**Objective**: Integration testing and documentation.

- Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless frontend and backend interaction.
- Document your project, including user guides and developer documentation.

## Day 7 - Day 10:

**Objective**: Security, Optimization, and Deployment.

- Implement security measures on the backend to protect against code injection.
- Optimize your application for performance and scalability.
- Consider deploying your application to a web server or cloud platform.

## Day 11 - Day 14:

**Objective**: Continuous Improvement and Testing.

- Gather user feedback and make improvements based on user needs.
- Perform comprehensive testing to ensure stability and resolve critical bugs.
- Conduct load testing to assess performance under heavy usage.
- Make final enhancements and refinements based on feedback and testing.
