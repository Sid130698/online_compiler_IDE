- Support multiple programming languages for code execution.
- Provide a platform for code sharing and collaboration.
- Encourage contributions from the open-source community.

## Scope

### Core Features (Week 1)

- Set up project structure and version control (GitHub).
- Implement socket communication for code submissions.
- Create a basic UI for the code editor.
- Enable code compilation and execution for one programming language (e.g., Java).

### Advanced Features (Week 2)

- Add support for multiple programming languages.
- Implement code saving and sharing features.
- Optional: Implement user registration and authentication.
- Optional: Implement community features like comments and discussions.

## Development Plan

### Day 1
